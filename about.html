             <p class="AboutParagraph-1">Hi, I’m Toreigh, an enthusiastic and funny (well at least I think so) UX/UI graduate designer based in Adelaide, Australia. Specialising in empathetic story-telling and creative problem solving I have a great love and respect for the power of team work and collaboration. I’m passionate about designing user-centred solutions that will have a positive impact on people, communities and the environment. </p>

             <p>My past life as a special education teacher and disability support worker introduced me to the practice of human-centred design, in addition to empathizing the principles of inspiration, ideation and implementation were key to creating engaging and individualized lessons for each student I worked with. My experience working with a wide range of people has instilled in me the desire to create accessible and inclusive designs, that creates an exceptional user experience. </p>

By observing, questioning and listening deeper insights can be gained and preconceived notions are challenged making room for exciting possibilities.

By understanding the goals and aims for any interview I am able to utilise my skills in observation, active listening and empathy to dig deeper.
